Spatial Analysis of Waste Generation and Participation
📌 Overview
This project explores dry waste generation and participation rates across major Indian cities using spatial data analytics. Using Python and various open-source libraries, it visualizes waste patterns city-wise, pincode-wise, and coordinate-wise. The project helps uncover local hotspots, analyze behavioral patterns, and support targeted planning for urban waste management.

📂 Data Sources
Waste generation and participation data (provided by Bintix)

Pincode geolocation dataset (external)

Population data by city (external)

🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
Python – Core language for data analysis

Pandas – Data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Time series and scatter plots

Folium – Interactive maps

Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

GitHub + GitHack – For hosting interactive maps

Canva – Presentation design

ChatGPT – For ideation and refining analysis approaches

📊 Project Highlights
Cleaned and merged multiple datasets (waste, pincodes, population)

Created interactive maps to show waste and participation at city, pincode, and coordinate levels

Built time-series and comparative visuals for trend analysis

Classified pincodes into four categories:

High Waste, High Participation

High Waste, Low Participation

Low Waste, High Participation

Low Waste, Low Participation

Generated actionable insights for urban waste strategy

💡 Key Insights
Waste generation is fairly uniform across major cities, with small variations

High waste does not always imply high community participation

Certain pincodes show strong participation despite lower waste — ideal models for replication

Classification helps identify priority areas for interventions
